## Enums In Java
### Introduction 
- Grouped Constants with their own type are called as enums or user defined data type
- They can be created inside the class , and they can be created outside the class as well
- There is a enum class and all the enums are by default extending to that class
- Inside enum we can have variables,constructor,methods alongside the grouped constants
- For every contant we will have a seperate instance of method ,variables other than the grouped ones
- For every constant we do a public static final enum_name conatant= new enum_name()
- Number of objects created is the same as number of grouped constants that are present
