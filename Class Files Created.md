## Number Of Class Files Created
- In Java, the number of class files generated depends on several factors, including the number of classes, interfaces, and anonymous classes in your code, as well as how your code is structured. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **One Class, One File**: Typically, each top-level class or interface is stored in its own .class file. For example, if you have two top-level classes, `MyClass1` and `MyClass2`, you would have two .class files, `MyClass1.class` and `MyClass2.class`.

2. **Nested Classes**: If you have nested classes, the inner classes will be compiled into separate .class files, but their names will include the outer class's name. For example, if you have an outer class `Outer` with an inner class `Inner`, you would have `Outer.class` and `Outer$Inner.class` files.

3. **Anonymous Inner Classes**: If you use anonymous inner classes, a new .class file is generated for each anonymous inner class. The names of these files are generated by the compiler and may not be human-readable.

4. **Enums**: Enum types are compiled into their .class files.

5. **Interfaces**: Each interface is typically compiled into its own .class file.

6. **Annotations**: Annotation types are also compiled into their own .class files.

7. **Static Nested Classes**: As mentioned earlier, each static nested class gets its own .class file.

- The number of .class files is also influenced by how you organize your code into packages. Each package may have its own directory structure, and each class within a package will have its .class file within that package's directory.

- So, in a typical Java project, you might have multiple .class files, each corresponding to a class, interface, or nested class within your codebase. The exact number of .class files will depend on the complexity of your project and how you structure your classes and packages.
