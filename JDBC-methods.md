## Some important methods for JDBC
-  `ExecuteUpdate()`:The executeUpdate() method is commonly associated with database operations in Java, particularly when using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). This method is typically used to execute SQL statements that modify the data in a database, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.
- `ExecuteQuery`:The executeQuery method is used specifically for executing SQL SELECT statements, which retrieve data from the database. When you use executeQuery, you are expecting a result set as the output, and it is typically used for queries that return rows of data.
- `EXECUTE()`:This method returns a boolean value that indicates the type of result produced by the execution of a SQL statement. The method returns true if the result is a ResultSet (typically generated by a SELECT query), and false if the result is an update count or there is no result (for statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DDL).

## Statement Working
- In Java's JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), a `Statement` is an interface that represents a SQL statement that can be executed against a relational database. There are three main types of `Statement` objects:

1. **Statement**: Used for general-purpose SQL statements without parameters. It may be used when the SQL statement doesn't contain input parameters.

    ```java
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    ```

2. **PreparedStatement**: Used when you need to execute a SQL statement with input parameters. This helps prevent SQL injection attacks and may improve performance for repeated executions of the same statement with different parameters.

    ```java
    String sql = "INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (?, ?)";
    PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
    preparedStatement.setString(1, "value1");
    preparedStatement.setString(2, "value2");
    ```

3. **CallableStatement**: Used for executing stored procedures in the database. It extends `PreparedStatement` and provides additional methods for handling stored procedure calls.

    ```java
    String sql = "{call your_stored_procedure(?, ?)}";
    CallableStatement callableStatement = connection.prepareCall(sql);
    callableStatement.setString(1, "parameter1");
    callableStatement.setString(2, "parameter2");
    ```

All three types of statements (`Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement`) are obtained from a `Connection` object. Once you have executed a statement, you can retrieve results (for queries) using `ResultSet` and update counts (for insert, update, delete) using `getUpdateCount()`.


## Prepared Statement
- In Java's JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), a `PreparedStatement` is a type of `Statement` that is used to execute parameterized SQL queries. It allows you to precompile a SQL statement with placeholders for parameters, and then you can supply values for those parameters before executing the statement. The use of `PreparedStatement` helps prevent SQL injection attacks and may improve performance when executing the same SQL statement multiple times with different parameter values.

Here's a basic example of using a `PreparedStatement`:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Assuming you have a database connection
        Connection connection = // your database connection here

        try {
            // Example SQL statement with placeholders
            String sql = "SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE column1 = ? AND column2 = ?";
            
            // Create a PreparedStatement
            PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
            
            // Set values for the placeholders
            preparedStatement.setString(1, "value1");
            preparedStatement.setString(2, "value2");
            
            // Execute the query
            ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
            
            // Process the results
            while (resultSet.next()) {
                // Retrieve data from the result set
                String column1Value = resultSet.getString("column1");
                // ... process other columns
                
                // Print or do something with the data
                System.out.println("Column1 value: " + column1Value);
            }
            
            // Close the result set and prepared statement
            resultSet.close();
            preparedStatement.close();
            
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```


## Statement vs Prepared Statement

1. **Statement:**
   - **Usage:** Used for executing simple SQL queries without parameters.Works at run time
   - **SQL Injection Risk:** Higher risk of SQL injection because values are directly concatenated into the SQL query.
   - **Compilation:** The SQL query is sent to the database and compiled each time it is executed.
   - **Performance:** May be less efficient for repeated executions of the same SQL query.

   Example:
   ```java
   Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
   String sql = "SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE column1 = 'value'";
   ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(sql);
   ```

2. **PreparedStatement:**
   - **Usage:** Used for executing parameterized SQL queries. It's suitable for queries that have parameters that can be filled in later.Works at compile time
   - **SQL Injection Risk:** Lower risk of SQL injection because parameters are treated as placeholders, and the values are set separately.
   - **Compilation:** The SQL query is precompiled by the database, and only the parameter values are provided at execution time.
   - **Performance:** Can be more efficient for repeated executions of the same SQL query with different parameter values.

   Example:
   ```java
   PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE column1 = ?");
   preparedStatement.setString(1, "value");
   ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
   ```

## Some Important points about prepared Statement
- It is child interface of statement
- It is precompiled 
- Faster as compared to statement


## Batchupdate
- It reduces the number of hits to the database
- Multiple queries are given as a single batch to the database
- Biggest drawback is if on query fails execution all other queries will also not be executed
