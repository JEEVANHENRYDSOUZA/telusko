## Some Important Points Related to Interface

-  An interface can have any implementing class
-  All methods in interface are public abstract 
-  we cannot create object of interface class
- we can create  reference of interface class
- we use implements keyword for the implementing class
- an interface can extend another interface but cannot implement another interface
- empty interface is called as marker interface and it is allowed in java
- an interface can have variables but it  is public static final 
- none of the implementing class can modify data
- if we want to give body to a method inside interface we need to make it default 
- from java 8 we can have static methods in interface we cannot override  that method using implementing class
