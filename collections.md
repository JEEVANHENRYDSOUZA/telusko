## Collection 
### Limitation of Array
- We can only store similar data
- Size is fixed
- It demands contiguos memory location
- If we ant to store large data and manipulate/ handle it then it becomes dificult
- Those classes are called as Legacy Classes

### Collection
- It is a collection of interfaces
- It was introduced in 1.2 Java
- It is a set of interface & classes and each class follows a specific dsa to hnadle & manage large volume of both<br/>
hetrogenous and homogenous data
- There are 3 major interface
    - List-----> this is implemented by ArrayList & LinkedList
    - Queue ----> this is implemented by LinkedList & dequeue. dequeue implemented by priorityqueu ,array deque
    - Set  ---->  this is implemented by has set and linked has set



### ArrayList
- It follows array data structure
- Can store both hetrogenous and homogenous
- Data is stored as an object
- Size can grow or shrink dynamically
- It implements list interface
- Index based accessing is allowed but it is not efficient 
- Order of insertion is followed in ArrayList


### peekfirst pollfirst 
- peekfirst does not effect the collection
- pollfirst will effect the collection
- same goes with peeklast , polllast
