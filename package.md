## Packages 
- A package is a folder in Java
- We can have a folder inside a folder called as subfolders
- The naming convention for the folders is reverse domain name
- Example  ``` com.example.projectname.utility.date ```
- Whenever if things are present in a different package then we need to import it 
- Sub folders are called as sub-packages
- If things are in the same packege then there is no need to import
